# Hands-On Labs

This repository contains the practice files used throughout the courses that are part of the Python for Data Science, AI & Development: IBM Professional Data Engineer Certificate.

The lab practices provides hands-on learning on these modules:
- Python Basics:

  - Demonstrate an understanding of types in Python by converting or casting data types such as strings, floats, and integers.
  - Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
  - Describe how to manipulate strings by using a variety of methods and operations.
  - Build a program in JupyterLab to demonstrate your knowledge of types, expressions, and variables.
  - Work with, manipulate, and perform operations on strings in Python

- Python Data Structures:
  - Describe and manipulate tuple combinations and list data structures.
  - Execute basic tuple operations in Python.
  - Perform list operations in Python.
  - Write structures with correct keys and values to demonstrate understanding of dictionaries.
  - Work with and perform operations on dictionaries in Python.
  - Create sets to demonstrate understanding of the differences between sets, tuples, and lists.
  - Work with sets in Python, including operations and logic operations

- Python Programming Fundamentals:
  - Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
  - Work with objects and classes.
  - Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.
  - Use exception handling in Python.
  - Explain what functions do.
  - Build a function using inputs and outputs.
  - Explain how for loops and while loops work.
  - Work with condition statements in Python, including operators and branching.
  - Create and use loop statements in Python.
  
- Working with Data in Python:
  - Explain how Pandas use data frames.
  - Use Pandas for library and data analysis by using commands.
  - Read text files using Python libraries including open and with.
  - Use NumPy to create one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
  - Write and save files in Python.

- APIs, and Data Collection: This module delves into the unique ways to collect data by the use of APIs and webscraping. It further explores data collection by explaining how to read and collect data when dealing with different file formats. This lab practice has the following Learning objectives:
  - Explain the use of the HTTP protocol using the Requests Library method.
  - Describe how the URL Request Response HTTP protocol works.
  - Learn to apply simple, open-source APIs.
  - Perform basic webscraping using Python.
  - Work with different file formats using Python.
  - Explain the difference between APIs and REST APIs.
  - Summarize how APIs receive and send information.

There's a separate folder for each lab practice.
